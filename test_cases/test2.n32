! Niu32 test case 2

! Passes test case if:
! Program starts at location 0x10
! $t0 holds 0x1 at end
! $t1 holds 0xfffffffe at end
! $t2 holds 0x1 at end
! $t3 holds 0x1 at end
! $t4 holds 0x0 at end
! $t5 holds 0x8 at end

.ORIG 0x10            ! Skip the first four instr
GOTO start			  ! Goes to 0x18
.WORD 0xBEEF		  ! Stores 0xBEEF at 0x14
.NAME stak 0xffffffff ! Sets stak = 0xffffffff
